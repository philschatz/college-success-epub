<p id="fs-idm230349632">Revisit the questions you answered at the beginning of the chapter, and consider one option you learned in this chapter that might change your answer to one of them.</p>
<p id="fs-idm235815232">How confident are you in your skills at preparing for and taking tests? Take this quick survey to figure it out, ranking questions on a scale of 1–4, 1 meaning “least like me” and 4 meaning “most like me.”</p>
<ol id="fs-idm211651584">
<li>I believe I set aside enough time to prepare for tests.</li>
<li>If I don’t set aside enough time, or if life gets in the way, I can usually cram and get similar results.</li>
<li>I prefer to pull all-nighters. The adrenaline and urgency help me remember what I need come test time.</li>
<li>I study my notes, highlight book passages, and use flash cards, but I still don’t feel like I’m as successful as I should be on tests.</li>
