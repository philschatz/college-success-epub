class=\"has-noteref\"><span data-type=\"term\" class=\"no-emphasis\" id=\"term-00001\" group-by=\"I\">Identity theft</span> is one of the fastest growing crimes in the United States, and the FBI estimates that more than 10 million new victims are harmed each year.<a href=\"#ch10rfin-22\" role=\"doc-noteref\" epub:type=\"noteref\">22</a> Among the problems contributing to this rapid increase in identity theft are the significant amount of data stored online and the poor security practices of both individuals and companies. In 2017, Equifax announced that their security had been breached and the data of every adult in the country was likely compromised.<a href=\"#ch10rfin-23\" role=\"doc-noteref\" epub:type=\"noteref\">23</a></p><aside role=\"doc-footnote\" epub:type=\"footnote\" id=\"ch10rfin-22\"><div data-type=\"footnote-number\">22</div>https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2004/october/preventidt_102104</aside><aside role=\"doc-footnote\" epub:type=\"footnote\" id=\"ch10rfin-23\"><div data-type=\"footnote-number\">23</div>https://www.purposefulfinance.org/home/Articles/2017/understanding-the-equifax-security-breach</aside>\n\n<section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-idm263153072\"><h3 data-type=\"title\">Passwords and Security</h3>\n<p id=\"fs-idm263068288\" class=\"has-noteref\">The first line of defense to prevent identity theft is to create strong passwords and take other security measures with your online accounts. An important factor in the strength of a password is the length of the password.<a href=\"#ch10rfin-24\" role=\"doc-noteref\" epub:type=\"noteref\">24</a> This means a password of 12 characters or more is desirable. Consider using pass phrases, or short sentences, rather than passwords. You should vary your pass phrases for each site so a hacker that gets your password can only use it for a single site. Government agencies and security experts are recommending password management software such as LastPass to help with remembering all of these differing passwords.</p><aside role=\"doc-footnote\" epub:type=\"footnote\" id=\"ch10rfin-24\"><div data-type=\"footnote-number\">24</div>Information Security Institute. “Password Security:Complexity Versus Length.” 2019. https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/password-security-complexity-vs-length/</aside>\n<p id=\"fs-idm247857472\">Another important strategy is to implement two-factor authentication (TFA) on all your online accounts. TFA adds another method of identifying you in addition to your password. Many TFA systems use your cell phone and will text you a code to allow you to log in to your account. A criminal would then need both your password and access to your cell phone to log in. Check the settings on your email, bank website, and other accounts to see how to enable two-factor authentication.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"fs-idm253864672\"><h3 data-type=\"title\">Preventing and Dealing with Identity Theft</h3>\n<p id=\"fs-idm237813072\">Setting strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication will help keep criminals out of your online banking, email, and other important accounts. Many criminals use lower-tech methods of stealing your identity, however, including tricking or scaring you into giving out information or simply digging through your trash to find account statements.</p>\n<section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"fs-idm213003200\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Never Give Info to Someone Who Contacts You</h4>\n<p id=\"fs-idm242513008\">Never provide a person with personal information unless you initiated the contact. If someone calls you asking for personal information, tell them you’ll call them back. Then ignore the phone number or website they give you, and instead look up the phone number for the organization on their official website. A legitimate company or government agency will never require you to stay on the line with them to solve the problem.</p>\n</section>\n<section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"fs-idm223406224\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Shred Everything</h4>\n<p id=\"fs-idm249215344\">You should also purchase an inexpensive cross-cut shredder and get in the habit of shredding all paperwork and mail before you throw it away. A good rule of thumb is that if the paper has your name on it, you should shred it before throwing it out.</p>\n</section>\n<section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"fs-idm256215488\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Order Your Credit Report Annually</h4>\n<p id=\"fs-idm244187600\">At least once per year, you should get your credit report from the credit reporting agencies through annualcreditreport.com, which is the only website approved by the Federal and State governments. The three major agencies -- Transunion, Equifax, and Experian -- all provide the legally mandated free report through this website. Learn how to read a credit report from one of these agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm237951520\">Look for incorrect information or accounts you don’t recognize. If you see accounts you didn’t open on your credit report, file a report with the local police and the local FBI field office. You can also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission and Internet Crime Complaint Center.</p>\n<div data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\" id=\"fs-idm235209520\" class=\"analysis-question\" data-label=\"\"><h3 class=\"os-title\" data-type=\"title\">\n  <span class=\"os-title-label\">Analysis Question</span>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"os-note-body\">\n<p id=\"fs-idm250065920\">Think about your account passwords and your habits related to your identity security.

There are people who have devoted their entire educations and careers to mastering single areas of personal finance, such as taxes, investing, and estate planning. When you feel it’s time to get professional help, there are many qualified professionals who can assist you. Not everyone who calls themselves a financial adviser is actually looking out for your best interest, however.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm248315216\">The terms <em data-effect=\"italics\">financial adviser</em>, <em data-effect=\"italics\">financial planner</em>, <em data-effect=\"italics\">wealth manager</em>, and many other impressive-sounding job titles are not regulated by the government. Anyone can put these job titles on their business cards. You need to be able to differentiate between a qualified professional and those who are untrained product salespeople, predatory financial businesses, or outright scams.</p>\n<section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"fs-idm258260080\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Predatory Practices Aimed at College Students</h4>\n<p id=\"fs-idm261810544\">As a college student, you are a prime target for predatory practices designed to make the adviser or company rich at your expense.</p>\n<section data-depth=\"3\" id=\"fs-idm260468224\"><h5 data-type=\"title\">Annuities and Life Insurance</h5>\n<p id=\"fs-idm255255504\" class=\"has-noteref\">Annuities and life insurance products are often aggressively sold to college students. They are generally inappropriate for college students and even most college graduates because they have high fees and lower returns than many other investment options, and the benefits are rarely needed by young people.<a href=\"#ch10rfin-25\" role=\"doc-noteref\" epub:type=\"noteref\">25</a></p><aside role=\"doc-footnote\" epub:type=\"footnote\" id=\"ch10rfin-25\"><div data-type=\"footnote-number\">25</div>North American Securities Administrators Association.

Your college may have a financial literacy, personal finance, or money management class available.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm259205824\">Be wary of personal finance or investing classes offered through other sources, however, as many include hidden sales agendas and aggressive pitches to buy a company’s financial products. Never make an investment decision, buy a product, or sign a contract at a class, and always seek advice from others on any opportunity.</p>\n</section>\n<section data-depth=\"3\" id=\"fs-idm234322416\"><h5 data-type=\"title\">Websites and Government Resources</h5>\n<p id=\"fs-idm244056672\">There are a ridiculous number of websites available to the public to help with your personal finances. When choosing a website for help, lean toward sites run by a legitimate government agencies or nonprofit organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm259403648\">The first place you should look for help with finances is the official website of related government agencies. If you have a question about insurance, look to your state’s insurance commissioner website. If you are having problems with your apartment, contact your city’s housing authority.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm228865536\">Government agencies not only have the authoritative word on any legal matter, but are also generally unbiased. The downside to government websites is that they can be hard to understand, with legal wording taken directly from the law. Some government agencies are also prohibited from giving advice to the public, leaving it up to you to apply the information they provide.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm256261920\">There are also many nonprofit organizations that have been established to assist the public with finances. Nonprofit organizations may have information that is easier to understand, and they may also be able to offer personal advice.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm259304736\"><strong>Official Government Websites</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"fs-idm256227952\">\n<li>Personal Finance: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, consumerfinance.gov</li>\n<li>Taxes: Internal Revenue Service, irs.gov</li>\n<li>Retirement: Social Security Administration, ssa.gov</li>\n<li>Investing: Securities Exchange Commission, sec.gov</li>\n<li>Investing: North American Securities Administrators Association, nasaa.org (state and provincial investment regulators)</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"fs-idm253150672\"><strong>Nonprofit Organization Websites</strong></p>\n<ul id=\"fs-idm247981648\">\n<li>National Endowment for Financial Education, nefe.org</li>\n<li>National Foundation for Credit Counseling, nfcc.org</li>\n<li>Consumer Reports, consumerreports.org (national consumer advocacy organization)</li>\n<li>Purposeful Finance, purposefulfinance.org (a nonprofit organization run by this chapter’s author)</li>\n</ul>\n</section>\n<section data-depth=\"3\" id=\"fs-idm257488624\"><h5 data-type=\"title\">Your College’s Financial Aid Office</h5>\n<p id=\"fs-idm255485280\">The financial aid or student aid office of your college may also be a good place to look for financial help, especially surrounding student loans. It is important to realize, however, that a conflict of interest exists between you and the financial aid adviser. Your college’s financial aid office is charged with helping you find the money to go to college, but it isn’t charged with making sure you don’t take on too much student debt. It is possible to get good advice on getting money to pay for college that is also bad advice for your future finances.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-idm249232848\">College financial aid counselors are also generally not trained in other areas of finance and should not be relied on for advice on investing, taxes, noncollege debt, or other financial matters. To get help with these areas, consult a qualified professional who can guide you with fewer conflicts of interest, such as the professionals listed below.</p>\n<div data-type=\"note\" data-has-label=\"true\" id=\"fs-idm225771744\" class=\"analysis-question\" data-label=\"\"><h3 class=\"os-title\" data-type=\"title\">\n  <span class=\"os-title-label\">Analysis Question</span>\n</h3>\n<div class=\"os-note-body\">\n<p id=\"fs-idm253336384\">Talk with your parents or other family members about their experience with finances, including financial advisers, taxes, legal issues, and investing.
