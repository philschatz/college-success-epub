<p id="fs-idm360964000"><strong>Rick says:</strong> I’ve wanted to work in radio since I was in high school and had great opportunities in college to learn at the campus station. I interned for a semester at a local Top 40 station and, after graduation, was offered a position as the producer of the station’s morning show.</p>
<p id="fs-idm339576768">The only problem: I had to be at the radio station by 4:45 a.m. I couldn’t do it. I tried everything—alarms on my phone, clock radio alarms, friends calling me. This is not a job you can be late for—dead air is a radio DJ’s greatest nightmare. But no matter what I tried, I could not wake up on time. The third time I arrived late, the radio station let me go.</p>
<p id="fs-idm344544416"><strong>Reflection question:</strong> How might you have handled the situation differently? How might this aspiring radio DJ have managed his time differently to ensure he was not late for work?</p>
<p id="fs-idm350723632"><strong>For discussion:</strong> Is the Internet responsible for most of our wasted work time? Read through this article. What do you think?</p>
