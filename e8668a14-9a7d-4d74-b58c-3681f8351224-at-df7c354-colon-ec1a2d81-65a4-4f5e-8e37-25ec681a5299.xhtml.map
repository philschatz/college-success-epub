However, like any professional-grade textbook, errors sometimes occur. Since our books are web based, we can make updates periodically when deemed pedagogically necessary.

FYE programs vary greatly according to institution, so the textbook has been developed to cover the most common concepts, and the open license and flexible formats provide many opportunities for coordinators, instructional designers, and faculty to tailor the material for their needs.\n\t</p>\n\t<p id=\"fs-idm1287299840\">\n\t\tThis book is an invitation—an invitation to students to step boldly into their college experience. <em data-effect=\"italics\">College Success</em> addresses the evolving challenges and opportunities of today’s diverse students. The intensive development work leveraged expertise from hundreds of FYE coordinators and faculty across the country. It highlights resources available to students as they embark on new roads of independence and responsibility. Students engage in careful self-analysis and research-based strategies to identify their strengths, challenges, and aptitudes. While they explore study skills and learning methods, they are continually asked to apply the concepts in reading, writing, and thinking exercises, which build both a solid base for classroom discussion and a portfolio they can augment throughout their college career. Recognizing the ubiquity of technology and social media, the authors address relevant information and advice where appropriate throughout the text. The material is rooted in motivation, growth-mindset, and resilience; student readers will feel seen and involved as they continually encounter one of the textbook’s core themes: “real-life” doesn’t stop when college starts.\n\t</p>\n\t<p id=\"fs-idm374776960\">\n\t\t<strong>Student engagement and self-analysis</strong> are reflected in each section through applications and activities.  Student reflection and opinions can be captured directly in the text, online, or in worksheets provided through the ancillary package.\n\t</p>\n\t<p id=\"fs-idm1315315328\">\n\t\t<strong>The diversity and intersectionality of students</strong> was considered in every example, context, and application, and the text’s active surveys and detailed profiles make student voices a key element of the reading.\n\t</p>\n\t<p id=\"fs-idm339542304\">\n\t\t<strong>Interconnected topics</strong> are acknowledged and built upon, demonstrating that no element of college learning and growth occurs in isolation.  The result is a cumulative, more complete understanding, which better prepares students to meet the multi-dimensional challenges of higher education.\n\t</p>\n\t<p id=\"fs-idm1258580064\">\n\t\t<strong>Openly licensed and free in all digital formats</strong>, the text provides unparalleled flexibility in its use, customization, and accessibility for faculty and students. The book is provided at no cost in online, pdf, epub, Kindle, and other formats. It is also available in print for a very low price.\n\t</p>\n\t<p id=\"fs-idm369704480\">\n\t\t<strong>Robust instructor ancillaries</strong> will support faculty and course designers with teaching notes, additional exercises, worksheet versions of the in-text activities, lecture slides, and assessment items.\n\t</p>\n\n\t<section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"fs-idm344900320\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Features</h4>\n\t\t<ul id=\"eip-418\"><li><strong>Student Profiles:</strong> The voices of real students inform every chapter. These students grapple with the same concepts, from improving study skills to embracing diversity, and through their experiences and successes we share important stories.</li>\n<li><strong>Get Connected:</strong> Apps, websites and tech opportunities that our experts recommend to help students better face the challenges of college and life beyond the classroom.</li>\n<li><strong>Analysis and Applications:</strong> Peppered through every chapter are opportunities for students to reflect on concepts, try out processes, and apply what they’re learning.</li>\n<li><strong>Career Connection:</strong> How can the material in each chapter help the student once they leave the classroom? Features at the end of every chapter help students apply what they’ve learned to work life. </li>\n<li><strong>Where Do You Go From Here?:</strong> Each chapter gives students the opportunity to dig in deeper and hone their research skills by choosing one topic for a closer look.</li></ul></section><section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"eip-343\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Student Surveys and Results</h4><p id=\"eip-428\">\nChapters begin and end with a survey, posing questions that will get readers engaged in considering their own level of connection and understanding of the chapter’s concept, from time management to personal finance to career planning. The close of each chapter revisits the survey, helping students gauge how their understanding has evolved.\n</p>\n<p id=\"eip-idm577447056\">\nStudent survey results are gathered anonymously and will be regularly provided to adopters as part of the instructor resources. (See below for more information on instructor resources.) In the future, the surveys will be assignable and the results viewable on an individual-course basis. For the survey results featured in the textbook, hundreds of students from a diverse array of colleges and universities provided their feedback to inform future students taking the course.\n</p></section><section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"eip-106\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Estimated Module Completion Time </h4><p id=\"eip-162\">\nEach section of College Success includes an estimate of the average time needed to read through the material, work on the activities and applications, and—where necessary—explore external websites or watch videos. Each student will engage the material differently, and faculty will likely prioritize or assign certain components over others. As a result, the actual time students spend will vary greatly. OpenStax will periodically update these estimates based on user feedback. As with all other elements of the text, these estimates may be adjusted by instructors (or deleted completely) based on addition or removal of material or activities.\n</p></section>\n</section><section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"eip-393\"><h3 data-type=\"title\">Additional Resources</h3><section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"eip-858\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Student and Instructor Resources</h4><p id=\"eip-460\">\nWe’ve compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including Getting Started Guides, lecture slides, and a Test Bank.\n</p><p id=\"eip-959\">The most robust of these is the Instructor Resource Manual, developed by author Amy Baldwin based on extensive experience and requests from faculty reviewers and survey respondents.  For each chapter, the IRM will contain:</p><ul id=\"eip-911\"><li>Detailed teaching suggestions</li>\n<li>Bloom’s Taxonomy matrix, indicating the alignment of each chapter activity and application to the level of Bloom’s it fulfills.</li>\n<li>Overarching “big picture” questions from the chapter</li>\n<li>Topical and cumulative case scenario activities, which present a realistic situation based on the concepts, and ask students to respond via writing or another method. These may be adapted and assigned by instructors.  </li>\n</ul><p id=\"eip-206\">Instructor resources require a verified instructor account, which you can apply for when you log in or create your account onOpenStax.org. Instructor and student resources are typically available within a few months after the book’s initial publication. Take advantage of these resources to supplement your OpenStax book.</p></section><section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"eip-600\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Community Hubs</h4><p id=\"eip-44\">\nOpenStax partners with the Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education (ISKME) to offer Community Hubs on OER Commons—a platform for instructors to share community-created resources that support OpenStax books, free of charge. Through our Community Hubs, instructors can upload their own materials or download resources to use in their own courses, including additional ancillaries, teaching material, multimedia, and relevant course content. We encourage instructors to join the hubs for the subjects most relevant to your teaching and research as an opportunity both to enrich your courses and to engage with other faculty.\n</p><p id=\"eip-606\">To reach the Community Hubs, visit www.oercommons.org/hubs/OpenStax.</p></section><section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"eip-253\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Technology Partners</h4><p id=\"eip-205\">\nAs allies in making high-quality learning materials accessible, our technology partners offer optional low-cost tools that are integrated with OpenStax books.
